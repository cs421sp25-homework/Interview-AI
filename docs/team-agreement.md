## Team Agreement

### Team Values

- Every team member must let each other know about any progress, challenges, questions, etc. (i.e. uphold collaboration and teamwork values) -- at least at each meeting.

- All team members must attend meetings and classes on time, as well as have completed their agreed upon portion prior to meeting. 

- We will make sure to listen to each others' ideas, be open to discussing ideas in a respectful manner, and give constructive feedback. 

- If any differences arise, we will make sure to address it in a timely manner, while maintaining a non-judgemental environment. 

- While members should make sure to complete their portion of the project, they should also support each other and the project as a whole.


### Team Communication

- The team will meet during each class, as well as coordinated meeting time(s) outside of class. We will aim to meet with our advisor or Professor Madooei at least once a week.

- If any member is unable to attend a meeting, they must let the team know ahead of time in the Slack. They will also be responsible to give their update and check on any team progress/pending tasks within 12 hours. 

- Every member is required to participate in the meetings. This could include progress updates, idea discussion, debugging, or asking/answering questions.

- Slack will be the primary communication tool, while texting via cell phone or WeChat will be used for urgent correspondence.
    - A response on Slack is expected within 12 hours. If a response is not received in time, the person responsible will buy coffee for everyone!
    - Use the üëç emoji to indicate agreement or acknowledgment.
    - Engage in a conversation in a dedicated thread (click "Reply to thread") for questions, comments, objections, etc.
    - Use the ‚úÖ emoji to show that action has been taken in response to a thread.
    - Use the üëÄ emoji to indicate that you will look into the matter later.
    
- Issues must be brought up and discussed as they arise.
