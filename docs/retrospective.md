## Iteration 1 Retrospective

**Dates:** 2/17 to 3/2

**Goal:** Foundational user authentication, profile setup, resume analysis.

---

## What Went Well

- [ ] Successfully implemented user authentication with email/password and Google sign-in.
- [ ] Profile page was developed, allowing users to upload their resumes and auto-populate relevant fields.
- [ ] Users can manually edit their resume-related fields, such as past experience and education.
- [ ] Profile customization features (name, profile picture) were successfully implemented.
- [ ] The core functionality worked well, and users could effectively create and modify their profiles.

---

## What Didnâ€™t Go Well

- [ ] Some challenges arose with third-party authentication, including token validation and session persistence.
- [ ] Debugging sign up & authentication errors took longer than anticipated.

---

## Lessons Learned

- [ ] Authentication flow requires early testing with different edge cases to prevent last-minute debugging.
- [ ] A more structured error-handling mechanism should be in place for third-party authentication.
- [ ] Breaking tasks into smaller subtasks and prioritizing critical features helped keep the iteration on track.

## Action Items for Next Iteration

- [ ] Implement voice and text input support for interview responses.
- [ ] Develop a conversational AI system that generates follow-up questions based on user responses.
- [ ] Allow users to input job descriptions to tailor AI-generated interview questions.
- [ ] Enhance AI capabilities to analyze user profiles and generate personalized technical and behavioral questions.
- [ ] Provide users with an option to select the type of questions they want to practice (technical, behavioral).

## Team Feedback

- [ ] Strong collaboration ensured that core features were completed successfully.
- [ ] More thorough initial testing of features could have prevented last-minute fixes.
